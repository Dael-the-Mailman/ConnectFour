# Connect Four AI
> Author: Kaleb Ugalde

The goal of this project is to explore and implement the [Monte Carlo Tree Search Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search) in the context of the game Connect Four. Much of this code was modified from the [AlphaZeroSimple](https://github.com/JoshVarty/AlphaZeroSimple) repository by Josh Varty. 

Inspiration for this project came after I lost a game of Connect Four. I was very angry and decided to create a program that can beat, or at least draw, any human. 

## How to play the game

## How to run unit tests
